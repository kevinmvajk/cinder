upgrade:
  - use oslo_middleware.sizelimit rather than cinder.api.middleware.sizelimit
    compatibility shim
deprecations:
  - cinder.api.middleware.sizelimit was deprecated in kilo and compatability
    shim added to call into oslo_middleware.  Using oslo_middleware.sizelimit
    directly will allow us to remove the compatability shim in a future
    release.
