    Updating the Datera DataFabric volume driver to API v2
features:
  - All Datera DataFabric backed volume-types will now use
    API version 2 with Datera DataFabric
upgrade:
  - This update is required to use the Datera DataFabric
    versions 1.0+ as a volume driver in OpenStack.  Versions
    before 1.0 will not be able to utilize this new driver
    since they still function on v1 of the Datera DataFabric
    API
deprecations:
  - Deprecated driver configuration options:
      - datera_api_token -- this has been replaced by
        san_login and san_password
